#AndroidDevChallenge
Tell us what your idea is.



Product Recognition . My Idea is to make an app for everyone not only for blind people. Where users can click a photo of any product like Dress,watches,shoes etc. They will find similar results of that product with same type,brand and color. Then they will be taken to purchase that product from amazon,alibaba and other sites.   

I tried making a simple video to explain. VIDEO LINK - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM1co_grIPg


Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life.


I had this idea for a long time and was working on it and I saw #AndroidDevChallenge is live which gave me hope and confidence to speed up the work. We really hope to solve the problem and hope to make this product widely accessible. For now this product is in ideation stage. 
 
First Phase:
We will add ML-Kit’s object detection, to detect what kind of object it is
Second Phase :
We will build feature where the product color and brand name is getting recognized. 
Third Phase:
Main part for training the models and displaying similar products 
 
How Google could help us achieve the goal :
Provide a Mentor for the project and for improvement in the idea
By advising ways to optimise the ML model
Help us get a BETA audience
Free credits/trail for Google APIs until it's released 
Data set for the project
